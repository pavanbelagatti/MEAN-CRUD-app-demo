# MEAN-CRUD-app-demo

## How to playaround?

### Clone the repository:
Git clone https://github.com/pavanbelagatti/MEAN-CRUD-app-demo.git on your terminal

### Backend part:

After cloning the repository, run 'npm start' from the backend folder

You should see the message on your terminal as below,

Connected to port 3000

Database sucessfully connected:) 

### Frontend part:

Open a new terminal from your computer and go to the applicaion folder and then go to the frontend folder and run 'ng serve' for a dev server. 
Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. 

You might get an error, so do 'npm install' to add all the dependencies required and then start again 'ng serve'

The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
