# MEAN-CRUD-app-demo

After cloning the repository, do npm start from the frontend folder

Once you do, you should see message on your terminal as below,

Connected to port 3000

Database sucessfully connected:) 

Let's get to the frontend part below

Open a new terminal from your computer and go to the applicaion folder and then go to the frontend folder and run 'ng serve' for a dev server. 
Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. 

You might get an error, so do 'npm install' and then start 'ng serve'

The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
